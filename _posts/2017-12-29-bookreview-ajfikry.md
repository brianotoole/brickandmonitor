#### Review
This book is slow, funny, and overall a little too tender for me. Yes, it's a *feel-good* book and I knew that going in. What I didn't know; however, was how painstakenly slow it would be. It took over 150 pages for it to *feel-good* for me, and while I will say the characters were interesting, they didn't seem to develop until around the 150 page mark. I hated the book until that point and was one energy drink away from removing the thought of this novel forever from my mind.

Then, I started to feel connected to the characters and decided to finish it out. I particularly enjoyed AJ's witty commentary on his favorite short stories and his interactions with his friends, such as the old lady who had to return a book for keeping her up all night. 

> There were some well-written scenes towards the end, but overall... it was just too much and too obvious for me.

#### Rating
**2/5 stars**, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in a *feel-good*, slow read. Those typically aren't for me.
