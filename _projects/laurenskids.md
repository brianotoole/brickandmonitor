takeaways: Since the Foundation’s inception, we have promoted its mission to the media, generating Florida and national media coverage about child sexual abuse prevention and positioning the Foundation and Lauren as experts. We promoted market-by-market media coverage of Lauren’s annual walk across Florida. Lauren and her cause have been featured on Nancy Grace, USA Today, Lisa Ling, Jane Velez-Mitchell, and the cover of Newsweek.
